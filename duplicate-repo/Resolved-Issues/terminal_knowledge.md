# Terminal Knowledge

1. Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

I chose Git Bash because it provides a Unix-like environment on Windows, supports all standard Git commands, and integrates well with other tools like VS Code.

2. What customizations (if any) did you make?

I personally like the classic black theme and the normal default font as its what i'm used to and i'm looking to added a few aliases for common Git commands, like gs for git status and gp for git push when i'm more comfortable with Git.

3. What was the most useful command you learned today?

The most useful command was git status, because it quickly shows the state of my working directory, including changes staged for commit, unstaged changes, and untracked files. This helps me stay organized and avoid mistakes.
