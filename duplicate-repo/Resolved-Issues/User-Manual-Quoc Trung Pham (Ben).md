üìù Reflection

1. What do you need from teammates to do your best work? (e.g., direct communication, flexibility, detailed instructions, minimal interruptions)

direct communication and detailed instructions would help significantly as i'll be able to communicate and understand the task. 

2. How do you prefer to communicate? (e.g., async messages, video calls, quick check-ins, long discussions)

3. What helps you stay focused and productive? (e.g., quiet workspace, deep work sessions, structured to-do lists, music)

A quiet workplace and a structured to-do list is especially helpful as i'm very prone to distractions should i relax for even a momemt.

4. How do you like to give and receive feedback? (e.g., clear & direct, with positive reinforcement, written vs. verbal feedback)

Clear and Direct, i still prefer a combination of written and verbal as there might be points in the written that needs verbal confiemation.

5. What are some quirks or things to know about your work style? (e.g., need time to process ideas, like to brainstorm out loud, prefer written instructions)

Need time to process ideas as i'm gonna be actively mapping it out in my head of what it should look like.

üõ†Ô∏è Task

1. Write your User Manual for Me using the structure below.

- User Manual for Quoc Trung Pham
  - My role
I am working on finishing my Onboarding Task
The days and times I work are: Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays from 12 to 17
  - How I Work Best
I do my best work when you give me clear instructions on what needs to be done and when it needs to be donw by.
I struggle when there are unclear details in the instruction as i worry about the end product not being what is required.
  - Communication Style
I prefer messages to be detailed and to the point when it is work related, i'm fine with goofing around and casual conversations outside of work.
The best way to reach me is probably discord as i've been on it a lot more recently due to another project.
If you need something urgent, call me directly on discord i'll always have my phone on me so i'll be able to pick up.
  - Collaboration & Teamwork
I work best in a team when everyone is contributing, talking, and willing to express their own opnions good or bad.
My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is if everyone is just quiet and no informations is passsed around making it harder to progress.
If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means i've got nothing to add to the conversation or topic being discussed otherwise i'll be providing what i know and what i think.
  - Focus & Productivity
I stay focused by listening to music and being in my own world.
Things that distract me loud noises and food smells.
The best way to support my productivity is to give me a task and a time it needs to be completed by then i'll be able to plan ahead when things need to be done.
  - Feedback & Growth
I like feedback to be direct with examples of what went wrong and how i can improve as i dont tend to make the same mistake twice.
When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is just to tell me directly or just shoot me a text if i'm not in the office i'll quickly make time to find out what the mistake was and how i can fix it.
I appreciate it when teammates are able to find fault in each other and willing to talk it through as that makes teams a lot more relaxed and everyone isn't so stressed about every little issue. 
  - Fun Facts & Quirks
One thing people often misunderstand about me is that i'm mean which while not wrong it is more so that i can't really tolerate wasting time when there are other things that i could be doing with that time whether its work or leisure.
A fun fact about me, i'm really like reading books and playing games normally if i have nothing to do so when i do have work to do i'll try to complete it to the best of my ability while keeping a quality of work i'm satisfied with.
My work superpower is the ability to forget about everything else when i'm actively trying to complete a task i'll be able to hear you but i won't be able to  turn to look at you or able to answer any questions especially when i'm close to completing the task.

2. Share it with your manager or teammates so they can better understand how to work with you.
