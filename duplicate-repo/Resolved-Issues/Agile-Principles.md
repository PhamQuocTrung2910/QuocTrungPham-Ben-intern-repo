üîç Research & Learn

1. What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?

- Agile is an iterative, flexible approach to project management that focuses on delivering value in small increments, adapting quickly to change, and involving stakeholders throughout the process.
In traditional project management (like Waterfall), work is planned in full detail upfront and executed in sequential phases. Agile, by contrast, adapts plans based on feedback and changing priorities.

2. What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)

- According to the Agile Manifesto, Agile values:
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation.
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
  - Responding to change over following a plan.

- Key principles include:
  - Deliver working solutions frequently.
  - Welcome changing requirements.
  - Collaborate daily with stakeholders.
  - Build projects around motivated individuals.
  - Maintain a sustainable pace.

3. What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?

- Scrum works in fixed-length sprints (usually 1‚Äì4 weeks), with defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team) and ceremonies like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives. It‚Äôs best for projects needing structure, predictable deadlines, and iterative planning.

- Kanban uses a continuous flow of work, visualized on a board. Tasks are pulled when capacity allows, with no set sprint cycles. It‚Äôs better for teams with changing priorities or ongoing operational work.

4. Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?

- Focus Bear‚Äôs work involves frequent updates, changing priorities, and continuous improvements rather than fixed sprint deliverables. Kanban‚Äôs flexibility makes it easier to adapt without having to wait for the next sprint cycle.

üìù Reflection

1. What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?

- Benefits: Adaptability to change, better collaboration, continuous delivery of value.
- Challenges: Can feel chaotic without discipline, requires strong communication, hard to estimate deadlines in highly dynamic projects.

2. How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?

- As an intern, Agile‚Äôs focus on transparency and quick feedback helps me learn faster, stay aligned with team priorities, and adjust my work based on real-time input.

üõ†Ô∏è Task

1. Summarize the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.

Scrum is like cooking a full meal in set courses, where you plan the menu, prepare everything for that course, serve it, then move to the next. Kanban is like running a food truck where you keep cooking and serving dishes as orders come in, adjusting the menu based on demand, without waiting for a ‚Äúnext course.‚Äù

2. Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.

‚ÄúWelcome changing requirements, even late in development.‚Äù This mindset helps me adapt quickly when feedback or priorities shift.
