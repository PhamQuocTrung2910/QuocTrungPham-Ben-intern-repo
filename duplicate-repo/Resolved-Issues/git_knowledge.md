# Git Knowledge

1. Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?

Yes, I’ve used Git for version control in personal projects and coursework. I’ve
used it to track changes in code, collaborate with classmates on group
assignments, and manage different branches for feature development.

1. Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?

I primarily use GitHub Desktop for quick visual commits and repository
management since it’s more user-friendly for reviewing changes. I've also
recently been using Git on VSCode for some projects.

1. What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?

I learned about merge conflicts and why they occur, especially how concurrent
changes to the same lines or files can prevent automatic merging. Understanding
how to resolve conflicts manually was particularly enlightening. When i used Git
previously it was very uncommon to have merge conflicts as we often had people
working on a certain part for most of the project to prevent it from occuring,
however in actual companies i understand that one task may have multiple people
working on it and there might be conflicts due to a variety of reasons such as
miscommunication.
