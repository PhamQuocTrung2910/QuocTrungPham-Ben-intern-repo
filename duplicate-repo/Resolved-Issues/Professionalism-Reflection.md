# Professionalism Reflection

üîç Research & Learn

1. What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual
   work environment? (Hint: Think about communication, meeting etiquette, and
   teamwork.)

- Communication
  - Professional: Clear, respectful messages; using appropriate language and
    tone; responding timely.
  - Unprofessional: Using slang or offensive language; ignoring messages;
    gossiping or spreading rumors.

- Meeting Etiquette
  - Professional: Being punctual; actively listening; staying on topic; muting
    when not speaking in virtual meetings.
  - Unprofessional: Arriving late or unprepared; interrupting others;
    multitasking visibly; leaving early without notice.

- Teamwork
  - Professional: Collaborating openly; sharing credit; offering help;
    respecting diverse opinions.
  - Unprofessional: Withholding information; taking credit for others‚Äô work;
    dismissing ideas; refusing to cooperate.

1. What does respectful communication look like in remote teams? (e.g., tone in
   messages, handling disagreements, responding to feedback)

- Using a friendly, clear, and positive tone in messages to avoid
  misunderstandings since you lack face-to-face cues.
- Being concise but polite, avoiding sarcasm or ambiguous language that can be
  misread.
- Listening actively and patiently during virtual meetings, allowing others to
  finish before responding.
- Handling disagreements calmly and constructively, focusing on ideas‚Äînot
  people‚Äîand seeking solutions together.
- Responding to feedback openly and appreciatively, even if it‚Äôs critical, and
  asking clarifying questions if needed.
- Respecting time zones and work hours by setting expectations for response
  times and scheduling meetings considerately.
- Using emojis or reactions thoughtfully to add warmth but not overuse them to
  maintain professionalism.

1. How can you give and receive feedback professionally? (e.g., focus on
   actions, not people; assume good intent; ask for clarification instead of
   reacting defensively)

- Giving Feedback:
  - Focus on specific actions or behaviors, not personal traits.
  - Use clear, respectful language and be constructive.
  - Assume good intent‚Äîapproach with empathy and a helpful mindset.
  - Balance critiques with positive observations when possible.
  - Offer suggestions for improvement rather than just pointing out faults.

- Receiving Feedback:
  - Listen actively and openly without interrupting.
  - Avoid defensiveness‚Äîremember feedback is about growth, not criticism.
  - Ask clarifying questions if something isn‚Äôt clear.
  - Reflect on the feedback before responding or taking action.
  - Thank the person for their input to encourage ongoing communication.

üìù Reflection

1. Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism?
   What made it effective?

I've experienced the best teamwork in one of my projects during a final project
where everyone was communicating and on calls constantly to finish task where we
spent nights up til late to complete task. It was me and 2 others, we would joke
around every so often to release tension and set task out clearly.

1. What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful,
   and inclusive?

Catergorizing the information into easy to understand chunks will make it clear,
respectful, and inclusive. From my experience the easiest task to be completed
in a team environment is the one with the clearest instructions, lik a task with
a list of sub steps to finish and we can assign different people to do each
part.

1. How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?

Be kind to everyone but don't enable someone to slack off just because you can
do something all by yourself, also talk to anyone who is talking to you as it
takes a bit of courage to go talk to someone these days.

1. How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?

Before the meeting think about the things that will be discussed during the
meeting and what you can add to the discussion, this will help you follow the
conversations people are having in the discussion.

1. What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?

I assume it would be to try to complete the onboarding as quickly as you can and
then participate in the improvement of the app, to be specific to my role the
Mobile App.

1. How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need
   information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't
   get a response and when would you escalate?

As stated previously in the summary the order should go Email, Discord/Teams,
SMS, Call You should only start escalating ahead once the estimated time for the
action is over, for example you should only Go SMS only after 24 hous of no
response from discord.

1. What are some things you won't do?

- Wait around for instructions without taking initiative.
- Show up to meetings unprepared or without questions.
- Ask questions that could be answered quickly by a simple Google search or
  ChatGPT.
- Ghost your project by failing to provide updates or communicate progress.
- Ignore feedback or fail to act on it, especially if it‚Äôs repeated.
- Rely only on one communication method and not escalate urgent issues properly.
