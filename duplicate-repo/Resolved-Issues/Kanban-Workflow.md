# Kanban Workflow

üîç Research & Learn

1. How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?

- A Kanban board visually represents work items and their progress through different stages. Tasks are placed in columns (e.g., Backlog ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done) and moved as work progresses. It helps manage workflow by making the status of every task visible, reducing confusion, and improving team coordination.

2. What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)

- Backlog: Tasks planned but not yet started.
- In Progress: Tasks currently being worked on.
- Blocked: Tasks that can‚Äôt move forward due to dependencies or issues.
- Done: Completed tasks that have met all requirements.

3. How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?

- Tasks move from left to right as work is started and completed. The person working on the task is usually responsible for updating its status, although in some teams the project manager also checks for accuracy.

4. What are the benefits of limiting work in progress (WIP)?

- Prevents task overload and context switching.
- Encourages completion of tasks before starting new ones.
- Improves focus and quality of work.
- Highlights bottlenecks early.

üìù Reflection

1. How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?

- Kanban keeps priorities visible and organized, ensuring that the most important tasks are worked on first. By limiting WIP, it stops the team from taking on too much at once, which reduces burnout and mistakes.

2. How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?

- I can set a personal WIP limit for my assigned tasks and update statuses daily so the team always has an accurate view of my progress.

üõ†Ô∏è Task

1. Check out Focus Bear‚Äôs Kanban board and note how tasks are structured. (Hint: Look in GitHub Projects.)

- Tasks are organized into columns by workflow stage, with labels for priority and assigned team members.

2. Move at least one task through the Kanban process and update its status correctly.

- While i have seen some of the KanBan Board duuring the stand up meeeting with Jeremy's screen i'm currently unable to access the Focus Bear KanBan board.

3. Identify one way you can improve task tracking in your role.

Since I‚Äôm still in onboarding, I can improve task tracking by adding clear, descriptive titles and due dates when creating new tasks, so they‚Äôre easier for the whole team to understand and prioritize.
