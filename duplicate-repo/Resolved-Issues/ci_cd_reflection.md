# CI/CD Reflection

1. Research what CI/CD is and why it’s used in software development.

- CI (Continuous Integration): Developers frequently merge code changes into a shared repository. Automated builds and tests run to detect issues early.
- CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment): Extends CI by automatically deploying tested code to staging or production environments.

- Why it’s used:
  - Faster feedback loop.
  - Early bug detection.
  - Reduced manual effort.
  - Consistent deployments.
  - Encourages small, incremental changes (safer and easier to review).

2. Set up a CI workflow that runs Markdown linting and spell checks on PRs in your repo.

3. Experiment with Git Hooks (e.g., Husky) to enforce linting before commits.

4. Open a test PR in your repository and review the automated checks.

5. Push your CI/CD configuration to your repo.

6. What is the purpose of CI/CD?

7. How does automating style checks improve project quality?

8. What are some challenges with enforcing checks in CI/CD?

9. How do CI/CD pipelines differ between small projects and large teams?
