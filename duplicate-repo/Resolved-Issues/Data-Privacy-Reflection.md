3. What are best practices for handling confidential data?

- Encrypt sensitive files:
  Encryption transforms data into a format that cannot be understood by anyone without the correct password or key. By encrypting important files, such as by setting file passwords, you prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing or using the information.

- Control data access:
  Maintaining confidentiality largely depends on restricting data access to only those who need it. Access should be granted solely to authorized users, who should secure their accounts with strong passwords and, when possible, two-factor authentication. Regularly review and update access permissions, promptly removing access when it‚Äôs no longer required.

- Physically secure devices and documents:
  Protect both digital devices and physical documents by storing them in locked or secure locations. Avoid leaving sensitive materials unattended, especially in public places, to prevent theft or misuse.

- Properly dispose of data, devices, and records:
  Once sensitive data is no longer needed, it must be disposed of securely. For example, erase sensitive information like Social Security numbers so it cannot be recovered. Devices that held confidential data should be securely wiped or destroyed. Paper documents containing sensitive information should be shredded rather than discarded normally.

- Manage data collection:
  Be mindful when gathering sensitive information‚Äîcollect only what is absolutely necessary. Reducing the amount of sensitive data collected helps lower confidentiality risks.

- Use data responsibly:
  Handle sensitive information only as authorized and necessary. Improper use can breach privacy and harm the individuals or groups the data concerns.

- Maintain device security:
  Protecting my devices helps secure the data they contain. Follow good cybersecurity practices like using antivirus software, regularly updating software, whitelisting trusted applications, setting device passcodes, enabling firewalls, suspending inactive sessions, and employing full disk encryption

4. How should you respond to a suspected data breach or accidental disclosure of confidential information?

When responding to a suspected data breach or accidental disclosure of confidential information, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) recommends a four-step process: contain, assess, notify, and review.

- Contain: Immediately take action to limit the breach and prevent further unauthorized access or disclosure.
  - This may involve:
    - Securing or shutting down affected systems.
    - Revoking access to compromised data.
    - Recovering or deleting exposed information.
    - Preserving evidence for investigation.
  - Avoid destroying evidence that could help identify the breach's cause or assess risks to affected individuals.

- Assess: Gather and evaluate information about the breach to understand its scope and potential impact.
  - Consider:
    - The type and sensitivity of the exposed personal information.
    - The circumstances and cause of the breach.
    - The likelihood and severity of harm to affected individuals.
  - This assessment will guide decisions on whether notification is required and what remedial actions to take.

- Notify: If the breach meets the criteria for an "eligible data breach" under the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme, notify:
  - Affected individuals: Inform them as soon as practicable, providing details of the breach and steps they can take to protect themselves.
  - OAIC: Report the breach using the OAIC's online Notifiable Data Breach form.
- Notification should be clear, timely, and sensitive to the potential harm caused.

- Review: After addressing the immediate impacts of the breach, conduct a thorough review to:
  - Identify the root cause of the breach.
  - Evaluate the effectiveness of the response.
  - Implement measures to prevent future breaches, such as:
    - Updating policies and procedures.
    - Enhancing staff training.
    - Improving security controls.
- Regularly test and update my personal data breach response plan to ensure preparedness.

üìù Reflection

1. What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?

I'll be setting up stronger passwords and also two-factor authentication for more sensitive information, also i'll be reviewing permissions for all future shared files to ensure no data leaks.

2. How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?

To store sensitive information safely, use encrypted devices or secure cloud services with strong access controls, ensuring only authorized users can access the data. When sharing, use encrypted communication channels like secure email or file transfer tools, and verify recipients‚Äô identities before sending. Avoid sharing sensitive data via unsecured methods such as regular email or public platforms. For disposal, permanently delete electronic files using secure erasure tools and physically destroy paper documents by shredding. Proper disposal prevents data recovery by unauthorized parties and reduces the risk of breaches, protecting confidentiality throughout the data lifecycle.

3. What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?

Common mistakes include weak passwords, sharing sensitive data via unsecured channels, lack of encryption, improper access controls, and failure to update software. Avoid these by using strong authentication, encrypting data, limiting access, regularly patching systems, get proper training on privacy best practices, and carefully managing data sharing.

üõ†Ô∏è Task

Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role.

A simple, effective habit to improve data security that i'll be doing is regularly logging out of systems and locking my device when away, even briefly. This prevents unauthorized access if my workstation is unattended and is easy to adopt immediately without technical changes.

Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement.

As stated above i'll start logging out and locking my device everytime i am away from it to stop attempts of unauthorized access of sensitive files.
