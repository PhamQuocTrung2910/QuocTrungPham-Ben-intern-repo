ðŸ“Œ Be completely honest in your evaluationâ€”Focus Bear might not always be better than other tools, and thatâ€™s okay! The goal is to understand the competitive landscape and think critically about where Focus Bear stands.

ðŸ“Œ Research other productivity and focus apps such as:

Freedom
Cold Turkey
Tiimo
Routinery
ðŸ“Œ Then, reflect on the following questions:

1. What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

- Focus Bear stands out by combining structured routines with built-in distraction blocking, making it particularly
  beneficial for individuals with ADHD or those seeking a more guided approach to productivity. Unlike Freedom and Cold Turkey, which primarily focus on blocking distractions, Focus Bear offers:
  - Pomodoro-based focus sessions: Encourages work-rest cycles to maintain energy levels.
  - Routine builder: Helps users establish and follow daily habits.
  - Distraction-free mode: Blocks distracting websites and apps during focus periods.
  - Customizable settings: Allows users to tailor their focus sessions and breaks.

This integrated approach addresses both the need for structured routines and the challenge of minimizing distractions.

2. If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?
   As a user, I would choose Focus Bear for its holistic approach to productivity. The combination of routine building, distraction blocking, and customizable focus sessions provides a comprehensive solution for maintaining focus and building healthy habits. Additionally, its user-friendly interface and features tailored for individuals with ADHD make it an appealing choice.

3. Whatâ€™s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesnâ€™t?
   While Focus Bear covers many productivity needs well, some competitors like Freedom or Cold Turkey offer more advanced or customizable distraction-blocking options, such as scheduled recurring blocks or more granular control over which apps/sites to block.

4. Based on your research, whatâ€™s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
   Focus Bear could enhance its customization options for distraction blockingâ€”offering more detailed scheduling, temporary overrides, or enhanced reporting on user focus patterns could help users optimize their routines even further.
