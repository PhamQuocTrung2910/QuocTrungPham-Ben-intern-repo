# Professionalism Reflection

üîç Research & Learn

1. What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual
   work environment? (Hint: Think about communication, meeting etiquette, and
   teamwork.)

- Communication
  - Professional: Clear, respectful messages; using appropriate language and
    tone; responding timely.
  - Unprofessional: Using slang or offensive language; ignoring messages;
    gossiping or spreading rumors.

- Meeting Etiquette
  - Professional: Being punctual; actively listening; staying on topic; muting
    when not speaking in virtual meetings.
  - Unprofessional: Arriving late or unprepared; interrupting others;
    multitasking visibly; leaving early without notice.

- Teamwork
  - Professional: Collaborating openly; sharing credit; offering help;
    respecting diverse opinions.
  - Unprofessional: Withholding information; taking credit for others‚Äô work;
    dismissing ideas; refusing to cooperate.

1. What does respectful communication look like in remote teams? (e.g., tone in
   messages, handling disagreements, responding to feedback)

- Using a friendly, clear, and positive tone in messages to avoid
  misunderstandings since you lack face-to-face cues.
- Being concise but polite, avoiding sarcasm or ambiguous language that can be
  misread.
- Listening actively and patiently during virtual meetings, allowing others to
  finish before responding.
- Handling disagreements calmly and constructively, focusing on ideas‚Äînot
  people‚Äîand seeking solutions together.
- Responding to feedback openly and appreciatively, even if it‚Äôs critical, and
  asking clarifying questions if needed.
- Respecting time zones and work hours by setting expectations for response
  times and scheduling meetings considerately.
- Using emojis or reactions thoughtfully to add warmth but not overuse them to
  maintain professionalism.

1. How can you give and receive feedback professionally? (e.g., focus on
   actions, not people; assume good intent; ask for clarification instead of
   reacting defensively)

- Giving Feedback:
  - Focus on specific actions or behaviors, not personal traits.
  - Use clear, respectful language and be constructive.
  - Assume good intent‚Äîapproach with empathy and a helpful mindset.
  - Balance critiques with positive observations when possible.
  - Offer suggestions for improvement rather than just pointing out faults.

- Receiving Feedback:
  - Listen actively and openly without interrupting.
  - Avoid defensiveness‚Äîremember feedback is about growth, not criticism.
  - Ask clarifying questions if something isn‚Äôt clear.
  - Reflect on the feedback before responding or taking action.
  - Thank the person for their input to encourage ongoing communication.

1. Review this guide for working with supervisors

- How to Work with Supervisors at Focus Bear ‚Äî Summary
- First Meeting: Come prepared by reading the project brief, bring questions,
  and have an agenda ready. Show initiative by doing some homework beforehand.
- Regular Meetings: Keep meetings focused and efficient. Include project names
  and agendas when scheduling. Ask questions after doing basic research. Take
  notes and follow up on action items.
- Communication Channels:
  - Email for general, non-urgent messages (reply within 48 hours)
  - Discord/Teams for medium priority (reply within 24 hours)
  - SMS for urgent issues (reply within 2 hours)
  - Call for true emergencies
- Be Proactive: Provide weekly updates, try solving issues yourself first
  (search online, ask teammates), then reach out to supervisors if stuck after
  30 minutes.
- Avoid: Waiting for instructions, coming unprepared to meetings, asking easily
  searchable questions, ghosting projects, ignoring feedback, and not escalating
  urgent matters properly.

üìù Reflection

1. Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism?
   What made it effective?

I experienced great teamwork during my final year project with two other
teammates. One challenge we faced was falling behind schedule because a feature
integration caused repeated errors. Instead of panicking, I suggested we split
the tasks more strategically: one person focused on debugging, another
documented test cases, and I worked on refactoring a core function that was
causing delays. We stayed on late-night calls to collaborate, shared progress
transparently, and joked around to ease stress. This mix of clear communication,
role clarity, and maintaining morale helped us deliver the project on time and
strengthened trust within the team.

1. What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful,
   and inclusive?

I will break information into smaller, easy-to-understand chunks, using bullet
points or numbered lists so that tasks are less overwhelming. For example, if
assigning mobile app bug fixes, I‚Äôd write: ‚Äú1. Check crash logs, 2. Replicate
error, 3. Submit fix.‚Äù This ensures clarity and inclusivity because everyone
knows what to do and when. From past experience, the easiest tasks were always
the ones with clear, structured instructions.

1. How can you help create a positive, fun, and professional work environment?

I can foster positivity by showing kindness, acknowledging teammates‚Äô
contributions, and being approachable. At the same time, I‚Äôll balance this with
accountability‚Äîfor example, if someone struggles to complete their part, I‚Äôll
offer help but also encourage them to stay engaged rather than silently taking
over. Even small gestures like responding warmly in chats or checking in when
someone seems quiet can make the environment both fun and professional.

1. How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?

Before meetings, I‚Äôll prepare by reviewing the agenda and noting where I can
contribute. For example, if the discussion is about the mobile app, I‚Äôll list
current bugs I‚Äôve identified, progress updates, and one or two improvement
ideas. Having this preparation allows me to follow the conversation more
actively and ask relevant questions, rather than just listening passively.

1. What would it look like to be proactive during your internship?

Being proactive means going beyond just onboarding. For my mobile app role, this
could mean identifying areas where the UI/UX can be streamlined, suggesting
improvements such as ‚Äúadding a quick-login option‚Äù or ‚Äúoptimizing API calls for
faster loading,‚Äù and bringing these ideas to team meetings. It also means
testing features thoroughly, documenting issues, and offering potential
solutions rather than waiting for instructions.

1. How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need
   information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't
   get a response and when would you escalate?

If I needed a code review urgently before a release, I would first send a direct
message on Discord. If there‚Äôs no reply after 24 hours, I would escalate by
sending an SMS. If I still don‚Äôt hear back within another 2 hours, I would
escalate further by making a call. This way, I respect communication hierarchies
and timelines but ensure important tasks don‚Äôt get blocked.

1. What are some things you won't do?

- Wait around for instructions without taking initiative.
- Show up to meetings unprepared or without questions.
- Ask questions that could be answered quickly by a simple Google search or
  ChatGPT.
- Ghost my project by failing to provide updates or communicate progress.
- Ignore feedback or fail to act on it, especially if it‚Äôs repeated.
- Rely only on one communication method and not escalate urgent issues properly.
