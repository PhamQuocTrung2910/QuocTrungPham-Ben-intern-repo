and key features.

üìå Then, reflect on the following questions:

1. Why do you think Focus Bear was created?

Focus Bear was created to address the unique productivity challenges faced by
individuals with ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The app was developed
by a neurodivergent team who found existing productivity tools inadequate for
their needs. They designed Focus Bear to provide structured routines, minimize
distractions, and support habit formation in a way that aligns with their
cognitive styles.

1. What problem is Focus Bear solving?

- Focus Bear tackles several issues:
  - Distraction Management: It blocks irrelevant websites and apps across
    devices using AI, helping users maintain focus.
  - Routine Building: The app guides users through personalized morning and
    evening routines, reducing decision fatigue and promoting consistency.
  - Break Optimization: It schedules and suggests breaks, including micro and
    Pomodoro breaks, to prevent burnout and maintain productivity.
  - Punctuality Support: Features like "Late No More" provide escalating
    notifications to ensure users are on time for meetings and appointments.

1. Why do you think this mission is important?

I think this mission is crucial because individuals with ADHD and ASD often face
systemic challenges in productivity and daily functioning. By providing tailored
tools that address these specific needs, Focus Bear empowers users to manage
their routines, reduce stress, and improve their quality of life. This approach
not only enhances individual well-being but also promotes inclusivity and equity
in productivity tools.

1. How does Focus Bear‚Äôs work align with your personal values or interests?

I also value inclusivity, personalized support, and practical solutions for
neurodivergent individuals, Focus Bear's mission resonates with these
principles. The app's emphasis on real-world applicability and user-centered
design reflects a commitment to creating tools that genuinely assist users in
their daily lives.

1. Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to
   solve?

Yes, I do. For example, during university, I often struggled with maintaining focus while studying at home. I would sit down with the intention of working on an assignment, but after just a few minutes I‚Äôd find myself distracted by social media or YouTube. This often meant I stayed up late to finish work, which left me drained the next day. If I had been using Focus Bear at that time, features like website blocking and structured break reminders could have kept me on track and prevented that cycle of distraction and burnout. Similarly, I sometimes struggled to stick to a consistent morning routine before classes. The guided routine feature would have helped me start the day in a structured way, improving both my focus and punctuality.
