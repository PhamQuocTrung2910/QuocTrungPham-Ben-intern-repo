# React Fundamentals

ðŸ“Œ Setting Up the Environment

- I successfully completed the setup of a React project with Tailwind CSS, verified that the styling was applied correctly by running the project, and documented the process in a README.md file. The main challenge I faced during this task was finding the most recent and accurate guide for configuring Tailwind with the latest version of React and Vite. Once I located an up-to-date resource, the installation and configuration steps were straightforward. This experience helped me better understand how to integrate Tailwind into a React project and reinforced the importance of relying on current documentation when setting up new environments.
