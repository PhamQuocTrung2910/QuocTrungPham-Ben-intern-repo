# Unit Testing

- Research what Jest is and why unit tests are important

- Jest is a JavaScript testing framework created by Meta that provides tools for
  writing and running tests, especially for React applications but also for
  general JavaScript and Node.js projects. It is popular because it includes
  features like test runners, mocking, and code coverage out of the box, making
  it easy to set up and use. Unit tests are important because they check
  individual parts of a program in isolation, ensuring that each function or
  component works correctly. This improves reliability, helps prevent bugs when
  making changes, and makes the codebase easier to maintain.

- I have completed setting up Jest in my React project, ensuring it was properly
  configured. I then wrote a simple test for a utility function, and ran the
  test to confirm that it passed successfully. After verifying the results, I
  pushed the test to GitHub to keep it version-controlled and available for
  collaboration.

- Why is automated testing important in software development?

- Automated testing is important because it reduces manual effort and human
  error by running tests quickly and consistently. It enables developers to
  validate code frequently, which is crucial for continuous integration and
  delivery pipelines. Automated tests improve development speed, maintain
  software quality at scale, and provide confidence when adding new features or
  refactoring existing code.

- What did you find challenging when writing your first Jest test?

- The main challenge when writing a first Jest test is shifting from writing
  functional code to thinking about how to test that code. It can be difficult
  to decide what parts of the program to test and how to structure the tests.
  Learning Jestâ€™s matchers, handling mocks, and setting up the testing
  environment can also feel unfamiliar at first.
