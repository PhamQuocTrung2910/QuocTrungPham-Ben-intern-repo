# Agile Roles

üîç Research & Learn

1. What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?

- Developers
  - Build and implement product features, fix bugs, write and maintain code, and
    collaborate on technical solutions. They also participate in sprint
    planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.

- QA (Quality Assurance)
  - Test the product to ensure it meets requirements, is bug-free, and delivers
    a smooth user experience. They create and run test cases, report bugs, and
    help maintain quality standards.

- Product Manager (PM)
  - Defines the product vision and strategy, prioritizes features based on user
    needs and business goals, and manages the product roadmap. Acts as the
    bridge between stakeholders and the development team.

- Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)
  - Facilitates Agile ceremonies, removes obstacles that block the team‚Äôs
    progress, and ensures the team follows Agile principles. Helps improve
    efficiency and communication.

- Other supporting roles (e.g., stakeholders, UX, customer support)
  - UX/UI Designers ‚Äì Create intuitive, accessible, and engaging designs based
    on user research.
  - Customer Support ‚Äì Brings feedback from users to help guide improvements.
  - Stakeholders ‚Äì Provide input, funding, and strategic direction.

1. How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?

- Scrum
  - Uses defined sprints (time-boxed cycles).
  - All roles collaborate during sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint
    reviews, and retrospectives.
  - Developers and QA work closely to complete all committed work within the
    sprint.
  - PM ensures backlog is ready before each sprint; Agile PM/Scrum Master keeps
    the team focused and removes blockers.

- Kanban
  - Work flows continuously‚Äîno fixed sprints.
  - Focus on limiting work-in-progress (WIP) and visualizing tasks on a board.
  - Developers, QA, and other roles pick up work as capacity allows.
  - Collaboration is ongoing rather than tied to sprint boundaries.

üìù Reflection

1. What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?

As a Mobile App Developer Intern, my role is to assist in building and improving
app features, fixing bugs, and collaborating with the team to ensure smooth
development. I contribute by turning user requirements into functional and
maintainable code while supporting the Agile team's goals.

1. How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the
   team?

My work should often overlaps with QA (to test and refine features), UX
designers (to ensure proper implementation of designs), and the PM (to clarify
requirements and priorities).

üõ†Ô∏è Task

1. Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.

I contribute to the Agile process by developing and maintaining mobile app
features, ensuring they align with user needs and product goals. I participate
in planning discussions, provide estimates, and collaborate with QA to deliver
high-quality features efficiently.

1. Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you
   can improve teamwork with them.

A role I'll be frequently collaborating with is QA (Quality Assurance) and I can
improve teamwork with QA by sharing feature changes early, providing clear
documentation for how features work, and staying available for quick
clarifications during testing.

1. Experience with QA

During a group project at university, I worked closely with a QA teammate while developing a login feature for our web app. After I implemented the login flow, QA tested it and found that the system allowed users to submit an empty password field, which wasn‚Äôt caught by my validation. Instead of just reporting the bug, the QA teammate explained how they tested it and why it was an issue for security. I updated the code by adding stricter client-side and server-side checks, then sent it back to QA for retesting. They confirmed the fix worked, and we closed the issue.

This experience taught me the value of QA‚Äôs perspective, they often think about edge cases I don‚Äôt immediately consider as a developer. It also showed me that quick, respectful collaboration helps the team ship more reliable features.
